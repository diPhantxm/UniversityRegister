# UniversityRegister
Register teachers of universities or schools to log attendance.
This project was made for my university, so I'll add some localization stuff eventually.

## Getting Started
  * Download Project
  * Set up api address in wwwroot/js/config.js and appsettings.json
  * Set up database connection string in API/appsettings.json
  * You are ready!
  
## Web app implementation
UI is implemented with JS and bootstrap.  
Authorization uses JWT. Bearer in API and cookie authorization in web app.  
DB requests are implemented with EF Core.  
JS connects backend with API calls.
